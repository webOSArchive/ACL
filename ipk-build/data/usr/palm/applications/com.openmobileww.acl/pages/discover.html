        <p> <b> OpenMobile Application Compatibility layer (ACL) enables Android apps to run on non-Android platforms. Gain access to thousands of apps on your webOS TouchPad device with ACL! </b> </p>
        <p> ACL delivers a full app ecosystem to webOS TouchPad tablet owners who have been waiting for a robust variety of their favorite apps since the tablet's initial launch. OpenMobile ACL for webOS performs properly on the revived TouchPad. ACL for webOS does not use virtualization or emulation to run Android apps in the webOS operating system. </p>
        <p> ACL-enabled Android apps perform as native on the webOS operating system, with minimal latency.</p>
