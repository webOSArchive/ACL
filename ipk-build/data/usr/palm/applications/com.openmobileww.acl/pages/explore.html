        <p> <b> Upon purchase and installation of OpenMobile ACL for webOS, you will have access to the OpenMobile AppMall. The AppMall is automatically packaged with ACL for webOS and is a single destination storefront for you to browse, search and find Android apps to download on your HP TouchPad! </b> </p>
		<p> <img src="images/appmall.png" align="left"> Find the OpenMobile AppMall icon upon completion of the ACL for webOS installation and tap to start finding and downloading all the apps you have been waiting for! Launch the AppMall on your TouchPad (BTW it is running thanks to ACL because it is a native Android app after all!) and take a look around to figure out which app you are going to download first! </p>
        <p> Downloading apps from the AppMall onto your ACL-enabled TouchPad is as simple as could be. Find the app you want and download directly to your device! The entire AppMall app catalog has been extensively tested and validated by the OpenMobile team, ensuring that each and every app will work seamlessly on your ACL-enabled TouchPad! </p>
		<p> The OpenMobile AppMall's app catalog is growing every day so if there is an app that you do not find, but would like to see included (and tested!), please let us know! While we do not capture individual search requests, we do analyze them in aggregate so that we can source test, and validate the apps that you want! </p>
