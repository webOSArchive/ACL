	The re-birth of webOS.
	</p>
	<p>
    Phoenix is making webOS possible again by creating strategic alliances with 
    companies from around the world with the same vision for webOS. The results
    will be new and innovative designs of webOS devices and making them
    available to people, like you, by the users and fans of webOS.
	</p>
	<p>
    Phoenix International Communications (PIC) is a group of volunteers from
    around the world with a considerable undertaking; to assist in the
    development, manufacturing, and implementation of new hardware running
    webOS. The hardware, phones, and tablets need to be manufactured to run the
    new Open Sourced webOS software that was created by Palm and made available
    by HP, the owners of webOS.

	<p>
    PIC is divided into groups: marketing, development, and finance. Each group
    has a mandate to further the cause, creation, and marketing of the product.
	Our vision is to build a version of webOS with that Phoenix touch that will
    start a fire throughout the social sphere, internet and beyond. Even though
    we have made great leaps in making that come true, we are small and we can’t
    do it alone. If you are curious and want to dig deeper to find out what we
    are about, feel free to send us an email telling us how you’d like to help.
    You can also like  us on Facebook and follow  us on Twitter. Catch up on the
    latest news, drawings, and special events.
	</p>
	<p>
    If you share the same passion, contact PIC and see if you can join the team
    and help push webOS into the hands of users around the globe.
